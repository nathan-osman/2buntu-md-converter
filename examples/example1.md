I've had it in drafts for a while - but I never got around to writing it, and after using this piece of sweetness one more time, I just had to do it man, I had to do it!

If you have never used, or heard of Decibel 2 before, then you have no clue what you are missing. It is an actively developed, feature-filled, yet minimalistic music player. It does what it says on the tin, and then some. Have you ever heard of a media player with a built in terminal? No, you probably haven't. Well guess what. This has one, and it works. I mean, sudo and all. I just added a PPA with it (before writing this).

In the spirit of minimalism, I'll stop here :). <h1>How do I get it?</h1> Here: <a href="http://gnomefiles.org/content/show.php/Decibel2+Audio+Player?content=146695&amp;PHPSESSID=97f49c52abf4f61d42ede759615eecf4" target="_blank"><em><strong>link</strong></em></a>. I've asked the author if he will add it to his PPA, still waiting for an answer.
